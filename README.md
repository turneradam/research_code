# TODO

Add wrapper lib for parsing outputs.

- This may include reading off the sheet and modifying parsing lines for different models.

Tests (Goddammit)

Analytic shit
- Cut out the chaff on the analytics end 
- Stop writing curse words as variable names
- Stop using curse words in documentation strings
- Stop using curse words in comments

Architect out the system

- Modularize the app so it is easier to use.

- Fix the problem that Adam talked about a while back that I can't remember

- Fix fwhm.py so that it splits the data via list[0] rather than list[1]
